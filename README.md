Flexbox Project - Landing Page! For The Odin Project

This is a project where the idea is to recreate a website layout for The Odin Project. The aim of this project is to practice my skills with CSS and flexbox, and be able to build the website from scratch. 

On reflection after completing the project I am very happy with what I've created. It was a lot of fun to do, and I felt fairly comfortable throughout. I didn't run in to any major problems which is a good sign. I have definitely learnt a few things and feel much more comfortable with the entire process now.
